In this assignment, you are required to write a menu-driven Java program that allows the user to add patients to a priority queue, display the next patient (and remove him/her from the queue), show a list of all patients currently waiting for treatment, and exit the program. The program should simulate the scheduling of patients in a clinic. Use the attached Patient class provided along with this assignment.
Your program should schedule patients in the queue according to the emergency of their cases from 1 to 5 (the higher the value, the higher the priority). If two patients have the same emergency value, use their order of arrival to set their priority (the lower the order, the higher the priority). It is up to you to have the Patient class implement either Comparable or Comparator.
Create a class PatientManager that has an attribute named waitingList of the type PriorityQueue<Patient> and a public method, start(). When start is called, it should display the following menu of choices to the user, and then ask the user to enter a choice from 1 to 4:
